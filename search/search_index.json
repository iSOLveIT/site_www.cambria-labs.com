We blend values, principles, and practices from three schools of thought:</p> <ul> <li>Lean startup</li> <li>User-centered design (UCD)</li> <li>Agile/extreme programming (XP)</li> </ul> <p>Additionally, we apply these philosophies within the structure of a \"balanced team.\"</p> <p>Cambria Labs didn't invent these philosophies; we have many individuals and teams to thank for sharing and refining these ideas. We have, however, developed our approach, tools, and platforms to enable these practices. Taking aspects of each philosophy, we combine and apply them using discipline, empathy, humility, curiosity, and a strong bias to action. We'll work closely with you to figure out how to adapt these methodologies for your organization. Our approach is always evolving as we continue to uncover new and better ways of building great software. What follows is a quick primer on product development, which will help you understand how we work.</p> <p>Lean startup</p> <p>A lean startup is an approach to developing businesses and products in environments with high uncertainty and change. It was created by entrepreneurs Eric Ries and Steve Blank. The two based their ideas on lean manufacturing, which was popularized by Toyota as a means of minimizing waste and maximizing productivity.</p> <p>Most products fail because they're based on flawed assumptions about user needs. Lean startup emphasizes investigating and validating assumptions around what customers need and meeting those needs with as little time, effort, and money as possible. Customer feedback is vital during product development. It ensures that we don't build products that customers don't want. The lean startup approach also borrows from the scientific method; it assumes we don't know something to be true unless we gather evidence to validate our beliefs. (Source: Eric Ries, The Lean Startup, Crown Publishing, 2011.)</p> <p>Common practices</p> <p>Minimum viable product (MVP), assumptions, continuous deployment, actionable metrics, pivot or persevere, build-measure-learn cycles, lean canvas, CI/CD</p> <p>User-centered design</p> <p>User-centered design (UCD) is a product design philosophy that emphasizes designing the product around how the user can, wants, or needs to use it, rather than seeking to change the user's behaviors to fit the product.</p> <p>We consider a user's needs from the very beginning of the product cycle and continuously validate our assumptions about their behaviors and problems. Using investigative methods like ethnographic study, contextual inquiry, and prototype testing, we validate and refine our understanding. The whole user experience is considered; we seek to understand the user's full context rather than just the task(s) they would complete by using the product.</p> <p>We conduct the design work iteratively, testing and evaluating design options early and often. Users are directly involved in the design process. Through observation and interviews, we seek to gain empathy for our users' goals, and use what we learn to ideate and evaluate design options and to inform design and development decisions.</p> <p>Perhaps the most influential writing done on UCD is Don Norman's The Design of Everyday Things (Basic Books, 2013) and Jeff Gothelf's Lean UX (O'Reilly Media, 2016).</p> <p>Common practices</p> <p>User interviews, personas, scenarios, think-make-check cycles, rapid prototyping, assumptions, validation, MVP</p> <p>Agile/XP</p> <p>Agile is a set of values and principles that enable teams to develop software with agility. Agile teams are quick, flexible, and responsive to change, without sacrificing quality. Although there are many implementations of this methodology, most use collaborative, cross-functional, and self-organizing teams to deliver software incrementally and iteratively.</p> <p>Extreme programming (XP) is a specific set of practices that implement agile values and principles. It was created by Kent Beck, author of Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change (Addison Wesley, 1999).</p> <p>XP enables teams to write high-quality software, ship it often and predictably, and be responsive to change. It's a strategy to help teams go fast, forever. XP is also a system - we only get to experience its full benefits when we implement all of its practices. That's why it's called extreme programming!</p> <p>Common practices</p> <p>Pair programming, test-driven development (TDD), refactoring, collective code ownership, delaying decisions until the last responsible moment, expecting changes in requirements, frequent communication, small and frequent releases</p>  <p>Note</p> <p>If there's a term here that is new to you, there's a good chance you'll find a definition for it in the glossary at the end of this guide.</p>  <p>Balanced team</p> <p>Our product teams are small, co-located or remote, and multidisciplinary. They are organized around goals established by the product sponsor(s) and are empowered to define and iterate on solutions that deliver against those goals. They're also empowered to talk to customers, make product decisions, and push code to production. By sitting next to each other or sharing virtual space, team members constantly communicate and collaborate. Teams are focused on delivering customer value through working software in small, iterative releases, and are self-organizing in that they can adapt common tools and practices to what works best for all members. Communication among team members tends to be informal, favoring spontaneous conversation over lengthy meetings.</p> <p>The concept behind this approach is what's known as a \"balanced team.\" It was created by a group of passionate agile practitioners who sought to better blend agile, UX, and other product disciplines. Early proponents of the balanced team concept include Jeff Patton, David Hussman, Desiree Sy, Jared Spool, and Lane Halley. Former Pivotal employees Janice Fraser and Tim McCoy were early participants, and Pivotal Labs hosted one of the first balanced team retreats.</p> <p>Though each project varies, the typical balanced team mix includes a Cambria Labs product manager, product designer, and engineer matched with full-time client counterparts. When we work within the construct of a balanced team, we ensure that all of these perspectives blend into and inform each other so that we build products that are desirable, usable, feasible, and viable.</p> <p>Common practices</p> <p>Shared vision, physical co-location, pairing across functions, scaling the team up/down based on what the product needs</p>"},{"location":"documentation/pm_playbook/#balanced-team-roles","title":"Balanced team roles","text":"<p>Team makeup and size can vary between product teams. What's important is having the right balance of skills and perspectives to make informed product decisions.</p> <p>Your role as product manager</p> <p>The product manager leads a team to discover and deliver a product that creates meaningful value for the company and its users. You'll facilitate decision-making in service of shipping successful features. To do so, you'll need to clearly understand who your users are and what they need, what impact the business expects from the product, and who your stakeholders are. You'll also need to collaborate closely with your team.</p> <p>Cambria Labs product manager pair</p> <p>In Cambria Labs projects, we pair client product managers with a Cambria Labs product manager who will guide and support the client product manager throughout the project. This pairing partner helps client product managers understand their role on a balanced team and learn how to take a lean/agile approach to product management. By applying the \"I do, we do, you do\" approach throughout the project, client product managers will gradually take the lead, with the Cambria Labs partner transitioning to a supporting role.</p> <p>Other roles on your team</p> <p>These are the most common roles you'll see on a balanced team. However, your team's roles may differ slightly depending on your product.</p> <p>Engineers</p> <p>Engineers implement stories from the backlog. They also assist with story estimation in the iteration planning meeting. Engineers guide the implementation and help you understand the technical implications of product decisions. You'll help them gain an understanding of what product success looks like, and work together to validate your backlog's prioritization.</p> <p>Anchor</p> <p>One engineer is designated as the anchor. The anchor ensures that the team makes sound technical decisions, that engineering practices are healthy and appropriate, that new and junior engineers get up to speed quickly, and that the engineering team collaborates well with product management and design. The anchor also ensures that the team collectively owns the codebase and understands the engineering decisions that are made. You'll collaborate more closely with your anchor than with the other engineers on your team.</p> <p>Designer</p> <p>Designers deliver value in the form of design decisions. Their job is to deeply understand the users to define solutions that are desirable, useful, and usable. You'll work closely with your designers, pairing on user research to validate critical user and solution assumptions before adding development work to the backlog.</p> <p>Delivery lead</p> <p>Each team has a Cambria Labs delivery lead. The delivery lead is responsible for the client relationship and the overall success of the project from the perspective of both the client and Cambria Labs. If needed, the delivery lead also helps to unblock the team and provide day-to-day support.</p> <p>Stakeholder and collaborators</p> <p>We often work closely with marketing, compliance, risk, infrastructure teams, legal, and other stakeholders. A good general rule for groups like this is to assign a point person, establish a regular touchpoint, and provide visibility into each other's roadmaps and/or backlogs with some ability to influence them. If it makes sense, we make members of these groups co-locate with us on our balanced team.</p>"},{"location":"documentation/pm_playbook/#balanced-team-in-practice","title":"Balanced team in practice","text":"<p>To build a successful product, we need to answer three questions:</p> <ol> <li>Will it solve users' problems?</li> <li>Will it help our business?</li> <li>Can we build it well?</li> </ol> <p>Lean startup, user-centered design, and agile/XP help us identify the best answers to these questions. When we work within the construct of a balanced team, we ensure that all of these perspectives blend and inform each other.</p>  <p>Desirability: Will it solve users' problems?</p> <p>The product should be something that users want and that solves real problems.

The product manager's primary question is, \"By solving these specific user problems with these specific solutions, are we creating valuable user and business outcomes?\"</p>  <p>Caution</p> <p>If product managers become too focused on the business and cannot connect with users, they'll likely focus on solutions that don't solve any real needs, and thus don't get used.</p>  <p>Feasibility: Can we build it well?</p> <p>Product implementation has to be feasible and robust. Engineers' primary question is, \"What technical implementation will best satisfy the project and product goals?\" Engineers help us debate the feasibility and merit of potential solutions while remaining mindful of technology constraints.</p>  <p>Caution</p> <p>It doesn't help engineers to come up with feasible solutions that don't solve problems for users; that's not developing good software.

The most important piece of work is at the top. A well-organized and up-to-date backlog enables the team to build features and functionality efficiently, with a predictable rate of output.</p> <p>As the product manager, you own the backlog. However, you'll gather input from all perspectives on the team to inform priority.</p> <p>Breaking down the product</p> <p>Many teams build products horizontally, breaking the work down along architectural boundaries. For instance, separate teams might build the back-end and the front-end layers. The problem with this approach is that we can't ship anything usable to our users until we've finished and connected all the layers.</p> <p>Agile teams aspire to work in vertical slices, which means they build the product one small feature at a time. This allows teams to deliver new value to users frequently and get their feedback on the new functionality. Frequent user feedback helps agile teams make necessary adjustments sooner and at a smaller scale than with big releases.</p> <p>One vertical unit of development work may encompass GUI, client, and back-end work---whatever is needed to deliver one unit of value to the user. These thin vertical slices are commonly referred to as stories. As a product manager, you'll work closely with your team to split your development work into good stories.</p>  <p>The smaller the slices, the better</p> <p>The smaller we can make a story, the simpler it will be to understand, estimate, implement, and test. We can more easily predict when features will be ready to ship. Developers can rotate through the codebase quicker and grow the team's bus count. Small stories enable frequent, tangible progress, which makes the team, the stakeholders, and the product sponsors feel good and means that value is delivered quickly to both users and the business.</p> <p>Continuous prioritization enables agility</p> <p>Agile/XP teams practice continuous prioritization. That is, although we do look a few weeks ahead to plan our work at a high level, we don't commit to a fixed sprint scope. That's because we might at any time learn about unexpected changes or new information that causes us to reevaluate our priorities. Continuous prioritization enables us to maximize our responsiveness to changing conditions and navigate complexity and uncertainty better than if we were to stick to a detailed, upfront plan.</p> <p>Developers will always pick up and work on the story at the very top of the backlog, so the order of the stories is very important. A story's position in the backlog communicates its priority - the most important stories are at the top of the backlog, whereas less important stories are near the bottom. It's your job as a product manager to ensure the order of the backlog represents the latest priority.</p>"},{"location":"documentation/pm_playbook/#balance-value-quality-and-constraints","title":"Balance value, quality, and constraints","text":"<p>Lean/agile teams must frequently make tradeoffs between value, quality, and constraints to successfully respond to change.</p>  <p>Making tradeoffs against the right goals</p> <p>Project management and product management are two commonly applied mindsets when it comes to defining software success.</p> <p>The role of the project manager is a tactical one in that they're responsible for achieving a specific, predefined objective by following a plan with fixed start and end dates and a fixed budget. Success in project management means delivering on time, in scope, and on budget.</p> <p>However, in the context of product development, project management aims to solve the wrong problems. Product failure is rarely due to schedule slippage or cost overrun. It's more commonly caused by building something customers don't want, doesn't need, or that doesn't create sufficient business value.</p> <p>This is why the role of the product manager is critical to product success. Product managers are responsible for defining what the product is and for whom, and how the product will drive business impact.</p> <p>Success in product management means delivering the right value at the right time.</p> <p>Value, quality, and constraints</p> <p>Product initiatives have three goals:</p> <ol> <li>Create customer value that drives business impact.</li> <li>Build and maintain quality to enable the team to develop, at speed, for as long as the business requires.</li> <li>Deliver within given constraints around people, time, and scope.</li> </ol> <p>Companies often want to keep all three of the goals fixed. However, because change is inevitable, this leads to failure - something unpredictable happens, and the team can't realize all three goals and burns out trying. It's why lean/agile organizations maintain flexibility by keeping fixed two goals at most and making tradeoffs when needed.</p> <p>What is value and why does it matter?</p> <p>Value is the benefit delivered to customers through the features we build and the business impact created when customers engage with the product. Value is measured by what our customers want or desire, and by the KPI we must meet to have a successful business.</p> <p>To deliver value, we need to do the simplest thing that delights the customer while also enhancing our margin and helping to differentiate us in the market. This requires us to know what features to build or not build and to ship new and improved features continuously.</p> <p>What is quality and why does it matter?</p> <p>Quality is defined as reliability and adaptability. Reliability means that our customers have a consistently good experience using the product. Adaptability means that we're able to keep evolving the product at a predictable pace so that it continues to deliver future value. To maintain high quality and a steady foundation, we need to keep both our design and tech debt low.</p> <p>How should we think about constraints?</p> <p>Constraints are important, but they aren't the actual goals of the product. They work as guardrails for the team, establishing clear expectations around delivery. Only one of the three constraints - people, time, and scope - can be fixed.

Tracker calculates the points of all current stories to come up with the team velocity metric.  </li> <li>  Accept and Reject Stories that have been delivered await acceptance by the product manager. Functionality that matches the acceptance criteria outlined in the story should be accepted. Functionality that does not meet the acceptance criteria should be rejected, along with a comment explaining what is incorrect or missing.

This may take longer than expected and become a blocker for the team.</p>"},{"location":"documentation/pm_playbook/#help-establish-a-sustainable-pace","title":"Help establish a sustainable pace","text":"<p>To deliver value fast forever, we need to make sure we're running at a comfortable marathon pace rather than rushing through a series of high-intensity sprints.</p> <p>Let's go fast, forever</p> <p>Keeping a sustainable pace is a core tenet of XP. It states that the team should aim to establish a work pace that they can sustain indefinitely. This enables teams to build better software, ship it predictably, and do so with regularity.</p> <p>Cambria Labs communicates its belief in sustainable pace by encouraging teams to establish core hours (typically starting at 9 AM and ending at 6 PM sharp for co-located teams) with a full one-hour lunch break. Team stand-ups and other ceremonies should only be scheduled within core hours, and regular breaks throughout the day are encouraged to help everyone refresh between bursts of highly focused activities.</p> <p>More hours, more problems</p> <p>We believe that building a product is a marathon, not a sprint. We don't do \"crunch time\" at Cambria Labs. We believe that putting in significant overtime is detrimental to work quality, team productivity, and team health.</p> <p>Willpower is a depleting resource. If we don't replenish it with sleep and sufficient downtime, our discipline and work suffer. Long hours lead to burnout and poor decision-making. A developer who stays up late to code a feature will realize the next morning that they'll need to rewrite it all. Even if the code is good, working late without the rest of the team reduces shared ownership of the project by creating knowledge silos. Working just 8 hours a day at full intensity will produce better results than working extra hours regularly.</p> <p>We believe that Cambria Labs teams get more done by identifying and minimizing any nonproductive activities during the workday, as it allows them to focus on value-generating activities instead. Hours spent don't matter if we focus on maximizing the value we produce. Many clients report being exhausted after their first week on a product team with Cambria Labs--that's what happens when you get an uninterrupted 8 hours a day to work!</p> <p>Product managers play a critical role in maintaining a sustainable pace by prioritizing the right product and business goals and communicating with the right stakeholders to ensure that whatever is delivered isn't a surprise. This means conducting regular stakeholder check-ins and demos as needed, maintaining an up-to-date product roadmap, and creating consensus with the business to avoid scope creep and \"crunch time.\" Product managers should also lead efficiency-improving activities such as removing team blockers, eliminating unproductive meetings, and boosting team morale. Think outside the box for how you can contribute to a sustainable pace and team happiness - no team ever complains when their product manager surprises them with donuts!</p>"},{"location":"documentation/pm_playbook/#communicate-effectively","title":"Communicate effectively","text":"<p>To launch successful products, you need to build a shared understanding with your team, your stakeholders, and your sponsors of the what, when, who, why, and how of the product and each iteration of it.</p> <p>Strong communication skills help you lead without authority</p> <p>You'll be championing your product to sponsors within your organization, making tradeoffs with stakeholders and other product teams, and facilitating the making of daily, tactical decisions within your team. You'll need to inspire trust as well as motivate and influence all parties to help you and your team bring a successful product to market. The strength of your communication skills will determine how well you'll be able to develop the credibility and strong relationships needed to do so.</p> <p>Stakeholders: Functional teams such as legal, security, sales, and marketing will want to know that you understand their needs and how your product supports their goals. For instance, marketing will want to know how your product will drive leads, and sales will want to know how your product will help close those leads.</p> <p>Sponsors: Executive sponsors will want to know how your product will increase the bottom line. Share with them the strategic objectives and KPIs you're working toward, and once launched, document and share with them the business impact the product is having.</p> <p>Core team: Create pathways for short feedback loops amongst core team members. Make sure you're responsive to your team's communication needs by being present and available. Share incoming information from sponsors and stakeholders quickly and as appropriate - shield the team from information overload while making sure they have the information they need to do their work.</p> <p>Others: Your team may be taking a very different approach to working than other teams in your organization. Help your colleagues understand how being lean/agile/user-centered impacts the cadence, needs, health, and success of your product and your product team.</p> <p>Tips for effective communication</p> <p>There are several ways to communicate effectively that are especially important as a product manager.</p> <p>Tell a story. Why does the product exist? Why does it matter? A compelling product story will make the product feel real and create an emotional bond, which will inspire others to invest in its success. Use anecdotes, user journeys, prototypes, videos, and other artifacts to help tell your product's story.</p> <p>Explain the big picture. Share the vision, strategy, and roadmap. Help everyone involved understand what outcomes you're working toward and how you'll know that you've succeeded.</p> <p>Be believable. When you communicate product decisions, make sure you do so with logic, empirical evidence, enthusiasm, and a focus on driving business impact by satisfying customer needs and desires. Let product designers and anchors communicate the rationale behind their design and technical decisions, respectively.</p> <p>Adjust the message and content to your audience. Tell them only what they need to know to make a decision or take an action.</p> <p>Be honest. When new information arrives that necessitates a shakeup of the product plan, you must have the courage to recognize any issues, communicate new data and insights back to the team and the product's stakeholders, and facilitate the creation and implementation of a new plan.</p> <p>Be proactive. To build trust with stakeholders and collaborators, share updates with them proactively. Don't wait until the last minute or when you need something to reach out.</p> <p>Listen well. Be as interested in learning from others as you are in sharing with them. Active listening will help you build stronger relationships and may also help you gain new insights that improve your product.</p>"},{"location":"documentation/pm_playbook/#glossary","title":"Glossary","text":"Agile A collection of software development methods based on iterative and incremental development in which requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self- organizing, cross-functional teams. It's a conceptual framework that promotes well-planned, small iterations throughout the development cycle.   Anchor role An experienced developer who, in addition to coding full time, leads the technical aspects of the project from start to end. The anchor acts as a resource for the rest of the development team for technical and nontechnical issues.   Backlog A list of prioritized stories that show the planned work for the current iteration. Stories can be added and removed from the backlog during an iteration and reprioritized as needed.   Balanced team An autonomous team composed of people with a variety of skills and perspectives who support each other toward a shared goal. The team values cross-disciplinary collaboration and iterative delivery.   Blocker A situation or issue raised during daily standup that's delaying or preventing project progress. The team self-organizes to resolve the blocker; when it cannot be unblocked by the team, it can be escalated to the client liaison and/or stakeholders.   Build, measure, learn A core component of lean startup methodology.Build-measure-learn is a feedback loop in which a team first figures out what problem needs to be solved, then builds and tests the smallest possible solution.   CI Continuous integration. A dedicated server that periodically runs a project-specific set of tests.   CD Continuous delivery. The ability to make changes safely and quickly into production and available for the user in a sustainable way.   Design crit A session designers run to get feedback from fellow designers and product managers.   Design review A weekly team meeting that yields the designer a clear list of updates to the designs and workflows they've presented based on feedback from developers, product managers, and client stakeholders around feasibility, business value, brand, priority, and scope.   Design studio A solution brainstorming activity a designer leads to gather ideas in the form of sketches.   Empathy The ability to understand what other people are thinking and feeling, to take their perspective. We hire for empathy and compassion because it enables us to be kind and effective collaborators, and good collaborators build happier teams.   Epic A collection of stories that make up a larger product release, feature set, or development focus. Epics are useful for prioritizing groups of stories against other groups of stories.   Iteration A planning cycle, typically lasting one week. Planning and development is iterative; because we're constantly coding and testing, the products we build are always ready to go live, which allows us to make changes in response to evolving business requirements. Daily and weekly software builds provide constant validation that the software meets the business requirements, so we always have complete control of the product and the timeline.   Iteration planning meeting (IPM) A weekly meeting at the start of an iteration during which the team reviews the upcoming stories in the backlog, ensures the backlog is full for the next two or three iterations, confirms the prioritization of stories, and estimates any unestimated stories using a point system.   Lean The practice of building products that deliver the most value to customers and minimizing waste by systematically identifying assumptions and validating them with actual users.   Minimum viable product (MVP) The cheapest, fastest, simplest thing that can help validate or invalidate a hypothesis about customer behavior.   Pair programming The practice of having two developers work together at the same computer to complete each task. At Cambria Labs, we pair all the time. This practice of focusing two minds on a single challenge leads to better decisions the first time around, fewer knowledge gaps, and continual implicit training and knowledge transfer. Pairing results in fewer defects, better code, and ultimately much more sustainably efficient development. As pairs rotate, knowledge spreads rapidly throughout the team, eliminating knowledge silos and enabling team growth.   Persona A prototypical model of a user based on research that collects the needs, goals, context, and tasks of multiple actual users. Personas help us gain and retain empathy for the users we serve.   Pivot or persevere Related to a change in strategy, not vision. To pivot means to change your business model, product, or target market based on feedback from the market that your current plan isn't working. To persevere means to continue to follow your plan based on feedback that it's working. You should regularly revisit your strategy in a \"pivot or persevere\" meeting.   Pointing In order to measure a story's complexity, Cambria Labs uses a point system of 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 points. During an IPM, developers will discuss and agree on a point estimate that--to the best of their understanding-reflects the story's complexity and risk. Points do not reflect a measure of how much time a story will take to complete since time is especially difficult to estimate and can vary based on external factors. Measuring relative complexity or risk is easier and yields more consistent assessments of team progress.   Rapid prototyping The quick and early development of a small-scale prototype used to test out certain key features of the product design. Useful for learning quickly and cheaply.   Retro A meeting that provides a team the opportunity to give positive and negative feedback to each other, in a structured way, to yield action items. Team members identify aspects of the previous week that went well and aspects that went poorly. We typically reflect on issues ranging from technical choices, to inter-role communication, to the working environment. We then group our reflections into themes, brainstorm around those themes, and assign action items to remedy any issues. To improve accountability, sometimes each retro begins with a review of the prior week's action items.   Risk (product) The probability of wasting time and resources on features that don't provide business or user value.   Service blueprint A diagram of a user's path through an experience, including physical, in-person,and onscreen touchpoints. The diagrams are key to communicating a complex flow, especially if there are multiple interactions spread over several days, weeks, or even months.   Standup A short, daily meeting--usually held first thing in the morning--to discuss what was accomplished the previous day, share any info that is valuable to the entire team, ask for help, and determine pairs for the day. The meeting is meant to be as short as possible; any discussions that only involve a subset of the team are moved into separate meetings.   Stakeholder An individual who stands to gain or lose from the success or failure of a product, feature, or solution. They understand and represent business interests or functional teams. They may also possess valuable knowledge about customers and end users.   Style guide A document that serves as a guide for visual design elements. More specifically, a living style guide is a living document of code, which details all the various elements and coded modules of the application.   Test-driven development (TDD) A software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle. The developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test and refactors the new code to acceptable standards.   User-centered design (UCD) An approach to product design where the user is put at the front and center of every design activity, so as to de-risk the product early and often. The team involves representative end users throughout the process of discovering, defining, designing, developing, delivering and optimizing the product in order to determine whether the features and user experience are useful and usable.   Velocity A measure of how many points a team can be expected to deliver in a given iteration that is calculated by averaging the points delivered in previous iterations.   Volatility A measure of how variable a team's velocity is.   Extreme programming (XP) A flavor of agile software development. Elements of XP include programming in pairs, automated testing of all code, avoiding the programming of features until they are actually needed, ensuring simplicity and clarity in code, expecting changes in customers requirements as time passes and the problem is better understood, and frequent communication--both with the customer and among programmers."},{"location":"documentation/pm_playbook/#reading-list","title":"Reading List","text":"<p>Check out these books, videos and articles to dive deeper into concepts and tools.</p> <p>Lean</p> <ul> <li>Lean Analytics  by Ben Yoskovitz and Alistair Croll</li> <li>The Lean Enterprise  by Trevor Owens and Obie Fernandez</li> <li>The Lean Startup  by Eric Ries</li> <li>The Lean UX  by Jeff Gothelf and Josh Seiden</li> <li>Running Lean  by Ash Maurya</li> <li>The Startup Way  by Eric Ries</li> <li>Making Sense of MVP  by Henrik Kniberg</li> </ul> <p>User-Centered</p> <ul> <li>The Design of Everyday Things  by Don Norman</li> <li>Just Enough Research  by Erika Hal</li> <li>Practical Empathy  by Indi Young</li> <li>Talking to Humans  by Giff Constable</li> <li>Satisfy The Cat  by John Boykin</li> </ul> <p>Pivotal Tracker</p> <ul> <li>Getting Started with Pivotal Tracker  by Pivotal Labs</li> </ul> <p>Agile Development</p> <ul> <li>Extreme Programming Explained (especially chapters 1-7)  by Kent Beck with Cynthia Andres</li> <li>Agile Product Ownership in a Nutshell  by Henrik Kniberg</li> <li>INVEST (mnemonic)</li> </ul> <p>Other</p> <ul> <li>Balanced Team  by Janice Fraser</li> <li>What makes a great product manager  by Michael Gresham, Adrien Hensley, Kenneth McDougall, Jennifer Handler</li> </ul>"},{"location":"documentation/pm_playbook/#credits-contributions","title":"Credits &amp;

This is called habit stacking.</p> <p>The habit stacking formula is: \u2018After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].</p> <p>The two most common cues are Time and Location.</p> <p>Creating an implementation intention is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a specific time and location.</p> <p>\u201cThe implementation intention formula is: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].\u201d</p> <p>Habit stacking is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a current habit.</p> <p>\u201cThe habit stacking formula is: After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].\u201d</p> <p>Motivation is Overrated -  Environment Often Matters More.</p> <p>Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior. Every habit is initiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues that stand out. Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment.</p> <p>People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations. It\u2019s easier to avoid temptation than resist it. One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.</p> <p>The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming. It is the anticipation of a reward\u2014not the fulfillment of it\u2014that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the motivation spike.</p> <p>Pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do</p> <p>We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe.\u201d</p> <p>We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups:\u00a0the close (family and friends),\u00a0the many (the tribe), and\u00a0the powerful (those with status and prestige).\u201d</p> <p>One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to\u00a0join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior\u00a0and (2)\u00a0you already have something in common with the group.</p> <p>The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes them. The prediction leads to a feeling. Highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit to make it seem unattractive.</p> <p>Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings and unattractive when we associate them with negative feelings. Create a motivation ritual by doing something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit. </p> <p>Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively more automatic through repetition.</p> <p>The amount of time you have been performing a habit is not as important as the number of times you have performed it.</p> <p>We will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work. </p> <p>Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible.</p> <p>\u201cReduce the friction associated with good behaviors. When friction is low, habits are easy.</p> <p>\u201cIncrease the friction associated with bad behaviors. When friction is high, habits are difficult.</p> <p>Prime your environment to make future actions easier.</p> <p>Habits can be completed in a few seconds but continue to impact your behavior for minutes or hours afterward.</p> <p>The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things.</p> <p>Standardize before you optimize. You can\u2019t improve a habit that doesn\u2019t exist.</p> <p>A commitment is a choice you make in the present that locks in better behavior in the future.</p> <p>The ultimate way to lock in future behavior is to automate your habits.</p> <p>Onetime choices\u2014like buying a better mattress or enrolling in an automatic savings plan\u2014are single actions that automate your future habits and deliver increasing returns over time.</p> <p>We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying. What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided. To get a habit to stick you need to feel immediately successful\u2014even if it\u2019s in a small way.</p> <p>Habit trackers and other visual forms of measurement can make your habits satisfying by providing clear evidence of your progress. Don\u2019t break the chain. Try to keep your habit streak alive.</p> <p>We are less likely to repeat a bad habit if it is painful or unsatisfying.</p> <p>An accountability partner can create an immediate cost to inaction. We care deeply about what others think of us, and we do not want others to have a lesser opinion of us.</p> <p>humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities.</p> <p>Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery</p> <p>Reflection and review is a process that allows you to remain conscious of your performance over time.</p> <p>When you\u2019re in motion, you\u2019re planning and strategizing and learning. Those are all good things, but they don\u2019t produce a result. Action, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that will deliver an outcome.</p> <p>The chains of habit are too light to be felt until they\u2019re too heavy to be broken.</p> <p>The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes a part of your identity. It\u2019s one thing to say I\u2019m the type of person who\u00a0wants\u00a0this. It\u2019s something very different to say I\u2019m the type of person who\u00a0is\u00a0this.</p> <p>Start at the identity level first and then build out from there. The\u00a0how\u00a0and the\u00a0what\u00a0components will naturally follow once you figure out the\u00a0who\u00a0part. Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.</p> <p>Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous.</p> <p>Little things add up to big things. Tiny actions, multiplied by millions can produce massive results. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.</p> <p>Successful people and unsuccessful people have the same goals. The goal cannot be what differentiates the successful people from the unsuccessful people. Having goals is not enough. Whether we succeed or fail depends on the quality of the system we develop to help us make progress once we\u2019ve chosen a direction. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You rise to the level of your system.</p> <p>If and when you achieve goals, it\u2019s not because you\u00a0set\u00a0them, it\u2019s because you set up the proper system to achieve them. If you want to see results, i.e. achieve your goals, you ought to worry far more about your system than anything else.</p> <p>We get good at what we practice.</p>"},{"location":"kb/topics/habits/#contributors","title":"Contributors","text":"<ul> <li>Sourced from \"Atomic Habits\" by James Clear.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"kb/topics/success/","title":"Success","text":"<p>The person who succeeds is the person who is progressively realizing a worthy ideal.
